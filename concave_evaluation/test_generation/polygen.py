def generatePolygon(ctrX, ctrY, aveRadius, irregularity, spikeyness, numVerts):
    '''Start with the centre of the polygon at ctrX, ctrY, 
    then creates the polygon by sampling points on a circle around the centre. 
    Randon noise is added by varying the angular spacing between sequential points,
    and by varying the radial distance of each point from the centre.

    Params:
    ctrX, ctrY - coordinates of the "centre" of the polygon
    aveRadius - in px, the average radius of this polygon, this roughly controls how large the polygon is, really only useful for order of magnitude.
    irregularity - [0,1] indicating how much variance there is in the angular spacing of vertices. [0,1] will map to [0, 2pi/numberOfVerts]
    spikeyness - [0,1] indicating how much variance there is in each vertex from the circle of radius aveRadius. [0,1] will map to [0, aveRadius]
    numVerts - self-explanatory

    Returns a list of vertices, in CCW order.
